# AWS Cloud Services Theory

This document covers key AWS services relevant to a senior engineer's experience, focusing on use cases, benefits, and important considerations. It's designed to help articulate practical knowledge and experience in an interview setting.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

Before diving into services, it's important to understand the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which guides cloud architects in building secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Its pillars are:

*   **Operational Excellence:** Running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
*   **Security:** Protecting information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** Using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Avoiding unnecessary costs.

> **TODO:** [Briefly mention how you've considered one or more pillars of the Well-Architected Framework when designing or reviewing solutions in your projects (e.g., ensuring reliability for Intralinks VDRPro, or cost optimization for a new microservice at Herc Rentals).]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"In my role at Herc Rentals, when we were designing new microservices, the **Cost Optimization** pillar was always a key consideration. We'd carefully evaluate EC2 instance sizes, choose appropriate S3 storage classes, and implement lifecycle policies. For example, for a new logging service, we decided to use a smaller initial set of EC2 instances with Auto Scaling, and routed logs to S3 Infrequent Access after 30 days to save costs, while ensuring performance during active use. We also emphasized **Reliability** by deploying across multiple AZs and using RDS Multi-AZ features."

## Compute Services

### 1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Virtual servers in the cloud.
*   **Use Cases:** Hosting applications (web servers, application servers, databases), batch processing, development/test environments.
*   **Benefits:** Scalable, wide variety of instance types (general purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized), full control over OS and software stack.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Instance Types:** Choosing the right family and size based on workload needs.
    *   **AMIs (Amazon Machine Images):** Templates for launching instances.
    *   **Pricing Models:** On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Savings Plans.
    *   **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adjusting capacity to maintain performance and optimize costs.
    *   **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):** Distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

> **TODO:** [Describe a scenario from your work at Intralinks, Herc Rentals, or Bank of America where you made a key decision regarding EC2 instance types, Auto Scaling configurations, or load balancing to optimize for cost, performance, or reliability for your Java applications.]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"At Herc Rentals, we ran several Java Spring Boot microservices on EC2. For a critical inventory lookup service that experienced spiky traffic, we configured an Auto Scaling group. Initially, we used M5 (general purpose) instances. After monitoring with CloudWatch, we noticed it was often CPU-bound during peak. We tested C5 (compute-optimized) instances of a similar size and found they handled the peak CPU load more efficiently, allowing us to potentially reduce the total number of instances needed during scaling events, thus optimizing for both performance and cost. We used Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in front, distributing traffic across instances in multiple AZs for high availability."

### 2. AWS Lambda

Serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events.
*   **Use Cases:** Data processing (e.g., S3 object processing), real-time file processing, backend for web/mobile apps (via API Gateway), scheduled jobs.
*   **Benefits:** No servers to manage, pay-per-use (only for compute time consumed), automatic scaling, integrates with many AWS services.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Event Sources:** S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis, CloudWatch Events, etc.
    *   **Runtimes:** Supports various languages (Java, Node.js, Python, etc.).
    *   **Concurrency Limits:** Account and regional limits on concurrent executions.
    *   **Execution Time Limits:** Maximum 15 minutes.
    *   **Cold Starts:** Latency when a function is invoked for the first time or after being idle. Provisioned Concurrency can mitigate this.
    *   **Statelessness:** Functions should ideally be stateless.

> **TODO:** [Detail your experience using Lambda for serverless functions. Can you provide an example from your projects (Intralinks, Herc Rentals, or TOPS) where Lambda helped solve a specific problem efficiently, perhaps for S3 event processing or as a simple API backend?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"At Intralinks, we used AWS Lambda for processing user-uploaded documents to S3. When a new document was uploaded to a specific S3 bucket, an S3 event notification would trigger a Lambda function written in Java. This function would then extract metadata from the document, generate a thumbnail, and update a DynamoDB table with this information. Lambda was perfect because it scaled automatically with the number of uploads, we only paid for the processing time, and we didn't have to manage any underlying EC2 instances for this task. This significantly simplified the architecture for this particular feature."

### 3. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

A highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers.
*   **Use Cases:** Deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications (microservices, batch jobs).
*   **Benefits:** Deep integration with AWS services (IAM, VPC, ELB, CloudWatch), supports Fargate (serverless compute for containers) or EC2 launch types, task definitions for defining application containers.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Launch Types:** EC2 (you manage underlying EC2 instances) vs. Fargate (serverless).
    *   **Task Definitions:** Blueprint for your application (Docker image, CPU/memory, ports, environment variables).
    *   **Services:** Manages long-running applications and tasks.
    *   **Clusters:** Logical grouping of tasks or services.
    *   **Load Balancing & Service Discovery:** Integration with ALB/NLB and AWS Cloud Map.

> **TODO:** [Describe your experience with ECS for deploying and managing your Java/Spring Boot microservices on AWS, perhaps at Herc Rentals or Intralinks. Did you use Fargate or EC2 launch types? What were some challenges or benefits you observed?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"At Herc Rentals, we used Amazon ECS with the EC2 launch type for deploying many of our Spring Boot microservices. We chose EC2 launch type initially as we had some existing EC2 capacity and specific instance types we wanted to leverage. We defined ECS Task Definitions for each microservice, specifying the Docker image (stored in ECR), CPU, memory, and port mappings. ECS Services then ensured the desired number of tasks were running and integrated with ALBs for traffic distribution. A key benefit was the ease of deployment and scaling. One challenge was managing the underlying EC2 cluster, ensuring it was patched and had enough capacity. We later started exploring Fargate for newer services to reduce this operational overhead."

### 4. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

A managed Kubernetes service to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
*   **Use Cases:** Running Kubernetes applications, migrating on-premise Kubernetes applications to AWS.
*   **Benefits:** Certified Kubernetes conformance, managed control plane, integrates with AWS services (VPC, IAM, ELB).
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Worker Nodes:** Managed by you (EC2 instances in Auto Scaling Groups) or using AWS Fargate.
    *   **Kubernetes Concepts:** Pods, Services, Deployments, Namespaces.
    *   **Networking:** VPC CNI plugin for pod networking.
    *   **Cost:** Pay for the EKS control plane and worker nodes/Fargate.

> **TODO:** [If you have EKS experience (resume mentions Kubernetes), describe a project where you used EKS. What were the reasons for choosing EKS over ECS or other solutions? What specific Kubernetes features or integrations were beneficial?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"While my primary container orchestration experience on AWS has been with ECS, I was involved in a project at Bank of America that evaluated EKS for a new suite of microservices that were already designed with Kubernetes in mind for potential multi-cloud portability. We chose EKS because the team had existing Kubernetes expertise, and it provided a standard Kubernetes API, making it easier to use familiar tools like `kubectl` and Helm. The managed control plane was a significant benefit, reducing operational burden. We utilized EKS with managed node groups (EC2) and leveraged AWS Load Balancer Controller for integrating with ALBs. The ability to define complex deployment strategies using native Kubernetes YAML was also a plus for that team."

## Storage Services

### 1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.
*   **Use Cases:** Storing application assets (images, videos, documents), backup and restore, data lakes, static website hosting.
*   **Benefits:** Highly durable (99.999999999%), scalable, cost-effective, various storage classes (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier).
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Bucket Policies & IAM:** For access control.
    *   **Versioning:** Keep multiple versions of an object.
    *   **Lifecycle Policies:** Automate moving objects between storage classes or deleting them.
    *   **Event Notifications:** Trigger actions (e.g., Lambda) on S3 events.
    *   **Consistency Model:** Strong read-after-write consistency for new objects; eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (though this has improved towards strong consistency for most cases).

> **TODO:** [How did you leverage S3 for data storage or application assets in the TOPS or Herc Rentals projects? Discuss any specific S3 features (like versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, or event notifications) you implemented and why.]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"In the TOPS project, S3 was a cornerstone for our data lake strategy. Raw telemetry data ingested via Kafka was eventually archived to S3 in Parquet format for long-term storage and ad-hoc analysis using Athena. We implemented S3 lifecycle policies to transition older data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive to optimize costs. We also used S3 event notifications; when new data batches landed in S3, an event would trigger a Lambda function to update a data catalog or kick off further processing jobs in AWS Glue. At Herc Rentals, S3 was used extensively for storing static website assets for AEM-published sites, fronted by CloudFront, and also for storing application logs and backups."

### 2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Persistent block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
*   **Use Cases:** Boot volumes for EC2 instances, storage for databases, file systems.
*   **Benefits:** Persistent (data survives instance termination if configured), various volume types (gp2/gp3, io1/io2, sc1, st1), snapshots for backups.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Volume Types:** General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3) for balanced price/performance, Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2) for I/O-intensive workloads.
    *   **Snapshots:** Point-in-time backups stored in S3.
    *   **Encryption:** Supports encryption at rest.
    *   **Performance:** IOPS and throughput depend on volume type and size.

> **TODO:** [Describe your experience with EBS volumes for EC2 instances running your applications or databases (e.g., for Spring Boot services at Herc Rentals or Intralinks). Did you have to make choices about EBS volume types or provisioned IOPS based on performance needs?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"For most of our EC2 instances running Spring Boot applications at Herc Rentals and Intralinks, we used General Purpose SSD (gp3) volumes for the root and application data. Gp3 provided a good balance of performance and cost, and we could provision IOPS and throughput independently of storage size, which was a benefit over gp2. For a few self-managed databases on EC2 (before migrating to RDS), we used Provisioned IOPS (io1) volumes to guarantee the necessary I/O performance for database workloads, especially for write-heavy operations. We regularly took EBS snapshots as part of our backup strategy."

### 3. Amazon S3 Glacier

Low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.
*   **Use Cases:** Archiving data that is infrequently accessed, backups.
*   **Retrieval Times:** Varies from minutes to hours depending on the retrieval option (Expedited, Standard, Bulk). Glacier Deep Archive offers even lower costs for longer retrieval times.

> **TODO:** [Have you used S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive for any archiving purposes in your projects, perhaps for compliance or long-term backup of data from Intralinks or TOPS?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"At Intralinks, due to financial industry regulations, we had requirements for long-term archival of certain transaction data and audit logs. We used S3 lifecycle policies to transition data from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier after a certain period (e.g., 1 year). For data that needed to be retained for 7+ years with very infrequent access, we further transitioned it to S3 Glacier Deep Archive to significantly reduce storage costs. Retrieval was rare, so the longer retrieval times were acceptable."

## Database Services

### 1. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

Managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB.
*   **Use Cases:** Hosting relational databases for applications.
*   **Benefits:** Easy to set up, operate, and scale; handles patching, backups, replication; Multi-AZ for high availability; Read Replicas for read scaling.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Database Engine Choice:** Based on application needs and familiarity.
    *   **Instance Sizing:** CPU, memory, storage.
    *   **Multi-AZ:** For HA and DR.
    *   **Read Replicas:** To offload read traffic.
    *   **Backup and Restore:** Automated and manual snapshots.

> **TODO:** [Reflect on your experience with AWS RDS. For projects like the Herc Admin Tool or backend services at Intralinks, which RDS engines (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) did you use? How did you leverage features like Multi-AZ or Read Replicas?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"For the Herc Admin Tool, we used Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The relational model was a perfect fit for the structured administrative data. We configured it as a Multi-AZ deployment from the start to ensure high availability; if the primary DB instance failed, RDS would automatically failover to the standby in another AZ. As read traffic grew for reporting features, we added a Read Replica to offload those queries, which significantly improved the performance of the primary instance responsible for transactional writes. We also relied on automated daily snapshots and configured transaction log retention for point-in-time recovery."

### 2. Amazon DynamoDB

Managed NoSQL key-value and document database.
*   **Use Cases:** Applications requiring high scalability, low-latency data access (e.g., gaming, ad tech, IoT, mobile apps), serverless applications.
*   **Benefits:** Single-digit millisecond latency, virtually unlimited throughput and storage, fully managed, serverless, Global Tables for multi-region replication.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Data Modeling:** Designing for access patterns (primary keys, secondary indexes).
    *   **Provisioned vs. On-Demand Capacity:** Choose based on workload predictability.
    *   **Indexes:** Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs), Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs).
    *   **Consistency Models:** Strong vs. Eventual consistency for reads.
    *   **DynamoDB Streams:** Capture item-level modifications.

> **TODO:** [When did you choose DynamoDB in your projects, perhaps for specific microservices at Herc Rentals/Intralinks or for data related to the TOPS Kafka pipelines? What were the driving factors (e.g., scalability, flexible schema, key-value access patterns) compared to RDS?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"While most of our core transactional data at Herc Rentals was in RDS, we used DynamoDB for a specific microservice that managed user session state and preferences. The access pattern was primarily key-value lookups (by session ID or user ID), and we needed very low latency and high scalability, especially during peak login times. DynamoDB's ability to scale seamlessly and its flexible schema were ideal. We used on-demand capacity mode to avoid over-provisioning. This was a better fit than RDS for this use case because the data wasn't highly relational and the primary requirement was fast key-based access at scale."

### 3. Amazon ElastiCache (for Redis or Memcached)

Managed in-memory caching service.
*   **Use Cases:** Caching database query results, session caching, real-time analytics.
*   **Benefits:** Improves application performance by reducing latency, reduces load on databases, managed service (patching, monitoring).
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Engine Choice:** Redis (more features like persistence, data structures) vs. Memcached (simpler, multi-threaded).
    *   **Cluster Mode (Redis):** Sharding data across multiple nodes.
    *   **Sizing and Scaling:** Node types, number of nodes.

> **TODO:** [You've listed Redis on your resume. How have you used ElastiCache for Redis in your Spring Boot applications (e.g., at Herc Rentals or Intralinks) for caching or session management? What benefits did it provide?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"At Intralinks, we used ElastiCache for Redis extensively as a distributed cache for our Spring Boot microservices. We cached frequently accessed data like user permissions, folder metadata, and results of expensive database queries. This significantly reduced latency for our end-users and decreased the read load on our backend RDS instances. We used Spring's caching abstractions (`@Cacheable`, `@CacheEvict`) with the Spring Data Redis module to integrate easily. The primary benefit was the substantial performance improvement for read-heavy operations."

## Networking Services

### 1. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Subnets:** Public (access to internet via Internet Gateway) and Private (no direct internet access, uses NAT Gateway/Instance for outbound).
    *   **Route Tables:** Control traffic routing.
    *   **Security Groups:** Stateful firewalls at the instance level.
    *   **NACLs (Network Access Control Lists):** Stateless firewalls at the subnet level.
    *   **VPC Peering/Transit Gateway:** Connecting VPCs.

> **TODO:** [Describe your experience designing or working with VPCs for your applications at Intralinks or Herc Rentals. How did you structure subnets, security groups, and NACLs to ensure security and proper network traffic flow for your Java microservices and databases?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"For our AWS deployments at Herc Rentals, we designed VPCs with public and private subnets across multiple AZs for high availability. Application Load Balancers and Bastion Hosts were placed in public subnets. Our Spring Boot microservices (running on EC2/ECS) and RDS databases were placed in private subnets to restrict direct internet access. Security Groups were our primary tool for instance-level security: application instances would only allow traffic from the ALB on specific ports, and database security groups would only allow traffic from the application security groups on the database port. NACLs were kept mostly open by default but used for broad deny rules if needed (e.g., blocking a known malicious IP range at the subnet level)."

### 2. Amazon API Gateway

Fully managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale.
*   **Use Cases:** Exposing backend HTTP endpoints (EC2, Lambda, other services) as APIs, RESTful APIs, WebSocket APIs.
*   **Benefits:** Handles traffic management, authorization/access control (IAM, Cognito, Lambda authorizers), throttling, caching, API versioning, SDK generation.

> **TODO:** [Did you use API Gateway in front of your Lambda functions or microservices in projects at Intralinks or Herc Rentals? What features like request validation, transformation, or authorization did you find most useful?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"Yes, at Herc Rentals, we used Amazon API Gateway to expose several of our backend Spring Boot microservices and some Lambda functions as RESTful APIs. We found features like request validation (defining models for request bodies) and JWT authorizers (integrated with our identity provider) particularly useful for securing our APIs. API Gateway also handled request throttling, protecting our backend services from being overwhelmed. For some public-facing APIs, we also configured API keys to manage access for different client applications."

### 3. Amazon Route 53

Scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
*   **Use Cases:** Domain registration, DNS routing, health checks for resources.
*   **Routing Policies:** Simple, Failover, Geolocation, Geoproximity, Latency, Weighted.

> **TODO:** [How have you used Route 53 for DNS management or routing policies in your AWS environments? Any experience with health checks or failover configurations?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"We used Route 53 for all our public DNS management at Herc Rentals and Intralinks. For critical applications, we configured Route 53 health checks against our Application Load Balancers. In one scenario, we set up a failover routing policy for a primary application stack in one region and a scaled-down standby in another region. If Route 53 health checks detected the primary region's ALB was unhealthy, it would automatically route traffic to the DR region's ALB."

### 4. Amazon CloudFront

Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) service.
*   **Use Cases:** Accelerating delivery of static and dynamic web content (images, videos, JS/CSS, APIs).
*   **Benefits:** Low latency, high data transfer speeds, DDoS protection (with AWS Shield), integrates with S3, EC2, ELB, API Gateway.

> **TODO:** [You mentioned using CloudFront with AEM at Herc Rentals. Can you elaborate on the types of content distributed and any specific configurations (e.g., cache behaviors, SSL, WAF integration) you managed?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"At Herc Rentals, for our AEM-published websites, CloudFront was crucial. We distributed all static assets like images, CSS, JavaScript, and even some read-only, semi-dynamic content served by AEM Publish instances. We configured cache behaviors to have longer TTLs for static assets and shorter TTLs or no caching for more dynamic paths. We used AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for free SSL/TLS certificates on our CloudFront distributions. We also integrated AWS WAF with CloudFront to protect against common web exploits like SQL injection and XSS for our AEM author and publish entry points."

---

## Management & Governance

### 1. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
*   **Key Concepts:** Users, Groups, Roles, Policies (JSON documents defining permissions).
*   **Best Practices:** Principle of least privilege, use roles for EC2 instances and services, MFA.

> **TODO:** [How did you apply IAM best practices in your projects? Describe an example of creating specific IAM roles or policies for your EC2 instances, ECS tasks, or Lambda functions to adhere to the principle of least privilege.]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"We strictly followed the principle of least privilege. For example, an EC2 instance running a Spring Boot application that needed to read from an S3 bucket and write to a DynamoDB table would have an IAM Role attached. This role would have policies granting only `s3:GetObject` permissions on the specific bucket and `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:Query` permissions on the specific table, rather than broad S3 or DynamoDB access. Similarly, ECS tasks for our microservices had specific IAM roles defining their permissions to interact with other AWS services like SQS or RDS, avoiding the use of long-lived credentials on instances."

### 2. Amazon CloudWatch

Monitoring and observability service.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Metrics:** Collects metrics from AWS services and custom applications.
    *   **Logs:** Centralized log management (CloudWatch Logs).
    *   **Alarms:** Trigger notifications or actions based on metric thresholds.
    *   **Dashboards:** Visualize metrics and logs.

> **TODO:** [You've listed ELK, Prometheus, and Grafana. How did CloudWatch complement these tools, or how did you use it directly for monitoring AWS resources (e.g., EC2 CPU/Memory, RDS connections, Lambda invocations) and setting up critical alarms in projects like Intralinks, TOPS, or Herc Rentals?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"While we used Prometheus/Grafana for detailed application-level metrics from our Spring Boot services and ELK for centralized application log analysis, CloudWatch was indispensable for monitoring the underlying AWS infrastructure and service-specific metrics. For instance, at Herc Rentals, we heavily relied on CloudWatch metrics for EC2 (CPU, Network I/O), RDS (DBConnections, CPUUtilization, Read/Write IOPS), and ALB (RequestCount, HealthyHostCount, TargetConnectionErrorCount). We set up CloudWatch Alarms on these metrics to notify our operations team via SNS and PagerDuty for critical issues, like sustained high CPU on EC2 instances, low freeable memory on RDS, or a surge in 5XX errors from the ALB. CloudWatch Logs was also used for collecting OS-level logs and logs from services like Lambda that don't easily integrate with an external ELK setup."

### 3. AWS CloudTrail

Records AWS API calls for your account.
*   **Use Cases:** Auditing, security analysis, operational troubleshooting, compliance.

> **TODO:** [Were there instances where you used CloudTrail logs for security auditing or troubleshooting operational issues related to AWS API calls in your projects?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"Yes, CloudTrail was an important tool for auditing and security. On one occasion at Intralinks, we noticed an unexpected configuration change on a critical security group. By reviewing CloudTrail logs, we were able to pinpoint which IAM user or role made the `ModifySecurityGroupRules` API call, the source IP, and the exact time, which helped us understand the cause and rectify the situation quickly. It was also used for routine security reviews to ensure API calls were originating from expected sources and roles."

### 4. AWS CloudFormation / CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) services.
*   **CloudFormation:** Declarative (JSON/YAML templates) way to model and provision AWS resources.
*   **CDK:** Define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.), which then synthesizes CloudFormation templates.

> **TODO:** [You have "CI/CD" on your resume. Did you use CloudFormation or CDK for provisioning and managing your AWS infrastructure as code? Can you give an example of a stack you managed?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"In my recent projects at Herc Rentals, we increasingly adopted Infrastructure as Code using AWS CloudFormation. For example, when deploying a new microservice, we would have a CloudFormation template that defined the ECS Service, Task Definition, ALB Target Group and Listener Rules, IAM Roles, and any associated SQS queues or DynamoDB tables. This allowed us to create and update environments consistently and reliably as part of our CI/CD pipeline (managed by Jenkins). For more complex stacks, we started exploring AWS CDK with TypeScript, as it allowed for more programmatic control and reusability in defining our infrastructure, which was a step up from writing verbose YAML in CloudFormation directly."

---

## Analytics & Big Data (Briefly, if relevant to Kafka/TOPS)

### 1. AWS Glue

Fully managed ETL (extract, transform, and load) service.
*   **Use Cases:** Data cataloging, ETL jobs for data lakes, preparing data for analytics.

### 2. Amazon Athena

Interactive query service to analyze data in S3 using standard SQL.
*   **Use Cases:** Ad-hoc querying of data in S3 data lakes, serverless querying.

### 3. Amazon Kinesis

Services for collecting, processing, and analyzing real-time streaming data.
*   **Kinesis Data Streams:** For ingesting and storing data streams (similar to Kafka).
*   **Kinesis Data Firehose:** For loading streaming data into data stores (S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch).
*   **Kinesis Data Analytics:** For processing and analyzing streaming data with SQL or Flink.

> **TODO:** [Given your Kafka experience on the TOPS project, can you compare/contrast Kafka with AWS Kinesis Data Streams? Were there any discussions or evaluations on using Kinesis as an alternative or supplement in that context?]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"In the TOPS project, Apache Kafka was the established backbone for our real-time data pipelines due to its high throughput, existing ecosystem integrations, and the team's deep expertise. While Kinesis Data Streams offers a managed alternative with similar capabilities for ingesting large volumes of streaming data, we didn't heavily consider migrating away from Kafka because of the significant investment already made. However, we did use Kinesis Data Firehose in a few instances as an easy way to stream processed data from Kafka (via a small Kafka consumer that then put records to Firehose) directly into S3 for archival and Athena querying, as it simplified that specific data sink integration."

## Security Services (Brief Overview)

### 1. AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

Managed service to create and control encryption keys.

### 2. AWS Security Hub

Comprehensive view of high-priority security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts.

### 3. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Helps protect web applications from common web exploits.

> **TODO:** [Briefly mention how you've ensured security for your applications on AWS. This could include using WAF with CloudFront/ALB, KMS for S3/EBS encryption, or adhering to security group best practices as discussed under VPC.]

**Sample Answer/Experience:**
"Security was a top priority. We used AWS WAF with our ALBs and CloudFront distributions to protect against common attacks like SQL injection and XSS. Data at rest was encrypted using KMS-managed keys for S3 buckets and EBS volumes. For data in transit, we enforced HTTPS on ALBs and CloudFront. And as discussed, our VPCs were designed with strict security groups and NACLs, following the principle of least privilege for network access to our EC2 instances and RDS databases."
