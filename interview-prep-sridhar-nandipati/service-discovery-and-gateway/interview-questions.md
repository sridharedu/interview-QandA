## Service Discovery & API Gateway Interview Questions (Senior Developer/Architect)

1.  You've worked with Spring Cloud Eureka for service discovery. Describe a scenario where you had to troubleshoot issues related to service registration or instance health within Eureka, perhaps in a dynamic AWS environment. What steps did you take to diagnose and resolve the problem, and what did you learn about Eureka's behavior (e.g., self-preservation, lease renewals)?
2.  When architecting the API Gateway for a system like TOPS, which likely handled diverse client requests, how would you approach the design of routing rules and filter chains using Spring Cloud Gateway? Discuss a complex scenario involving conditional routing, request transformation, or integration with a security module (like Spring Security for JWT validation) that you've handled.
3.  Compare and contrast client-side versus server-side service discovery. Given your experience with microservices on AWS, when would you advocate for using a client-side mechanism like Eureka with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, versus relying on AWS-native server-side discovery (e.g., ALB/NLB with ECS/EKS service discovery)? What are the trade-offs in terms of complexity, resilience, and control?
4.  Securing an API Gateway is paramount. Walk me through how you would design and implement a robust security strategy for a gateway. Consider aspects like OAuth 2.0/JWT validation (perhaps referencing your experience with Spring Security), rate limiting to prevent abuse, input validation, and secure communication to downstream services (mTLS or HTTPS). What are the most critical security vulnerabilities to guard against at the gateway level?
5.  Imagine your Spring Cloud Gateway instance is showing signs of performance degradation (increased latency, high CPU) under load. Describe your systematic approach to identifying the bottlenecks. Would you look into filter chain complexity, non-blocking I/O issues, JVM tuning, integration with service discovery, or other areas?
6.  Service registries like Consul offer features beyond basic discovery, such as a distributed Key-Value store and advanced health checking. If you were choosing between Eureka and Consul for a new project, what factors would drive your decision? Describe a situation where Consul's additional features might have been particularly beneficial.
7.  The Backend For Frontend (BFF) pattern suggests using multiple, specialized API Gateways for different client types. Have you implemented or considered this pattern? Discuss a scenario (e.g., from Intralinks or TOPS) where a BFF architecture could simplify client interactions or optimize payloads, and what challenges it might introduce.
8.  Implementing zero-downtime deployments (blue/green, canary) for microservices often involves the API Gateway. Describe how you would leverage Spring Cloud Gateway (or a similar tool) to manage traffic distribution during such a deployment. What specific gateway configurations or external tooling would you use?
9.  When implementing cross-cutting concerns like centralized logging or metrics collection at the API Gateway, what are the key considerations to ensure it doesn't negatively impact gateway performance or become overly complex? How have you used gateway-level data to gain insights into API usage and system health?
10. Discuss the challenges of managing and versioning API Gateway configurations (routes, filters) as the number of microservices and API consumers grows. What strategies (e.g., configuration-as-code, integration with a config server like Spring Cloud Config, GitOps practices) have you found effective for maintaining sanity and enabling safe updates?
11. Consider a scenario where a downstream service behind your API Gateway is experiencing intermittent failures. How would you configure your gateway (e.g., using Resilience4j with Spring Cloud Gateway) to handle these failures gracefully, provide meaningful responses to clients, and prevent cascading failures? Discuss retry strategies, circuit breaker thresholds, and fallback mechanisms.
12. In a complex microservices environment, ensuring end-to-end request traceability often starts at the gateway. How have you ensured that correlation IDs are generated or propagated correctly by the API Gateway, and how does this integrate with distributed tracing systems like Zipkin that you've used?
