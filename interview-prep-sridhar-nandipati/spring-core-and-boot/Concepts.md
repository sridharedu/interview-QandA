Here's a **highly structured, easy-to-navigate reference document** based on the video transcript: **“Dynamic Bean Switching in Spring Boot using Map-based Injection”** from Java Techie.

## 📚 **1. Detailed Topic Breakdown (Merged with Timeline Highlights)**

---

### 🔹 **Introduction to the Problem (0:00 – 0:50)**

* 🧠 **Summary**: Most developers use `if-else` or `switch` statements when handling multiple service implementations. This becomes inefficient and unscalable as the number of services grows.
* 💬 **Key Terminologies Used**:

    * **Service Implementation** – a concrete class that provides specific business logic.
    * **Controller** – receives input from the user and returns a response.
* 💡 **Common Problems Addressed**:

    * Manual selection using conditions.
    * Scalability issues when adding more services.

---

### 🔹 **Setup: PaymentService Interface with Multiple Implementations (1:02 – 2:15)**

* 🧠 **Summary**:
  An interface `PaymentService` is created with implementations for **PayPal**, **Razorpay**, and **Stripe**. Each has its own `pay()` logic.

* 🛠️ **Code, Examples**:

  ```java
  public interface PaymentService {
      String pay(PaymentRequest request);
  }

  @Service
  public class PaypalPaymentService implements PaymentService {
      public String pay(PaymentRequest request) {
          return "Paid with PayPal";
      }
  }
  ```

* 🔄 **Follow-up Topics / Dependencies**:
  Tied to Controller logic and input-driven routing.

---

### 🔹 **Traditional Approach using if-else/switch (2:15 – 3:01)**

* 🧠 **Summary**:
  In the controller, developer uses `if-else` or `switch` to inject the correct implementation based on user input.

* 💡 **Drawbacks**:

    * Requires updates every time a new implementation is added.
    * All beans are unnecessarily created even if not used.

---

### 🔹 **Dynamic Bean Selection using Map-based Injection (3:01 – 6:02)**

* 🧠 **Summary**:
  Spring Boot can inject a `Map<String, PaymentService>` where the key is the bean name and the value is the corresponding implementation. Based on user input, the correct bean is retrieved and used.

* 📖 **Extended Explanation**:
  By leveraging constructor injection with a `Map`, Spring populates it with all beans implementing the `PaymentService` interface. Keys are bean names, values are objects.

* 🛠️ **Code**:

  ```java
  @RestController
  public class PaymentControllerV2 {

      private final Map<String, PaymentService> paymentServiceMap;

      public PaymentControllerV2(Map<String, PaymentService> paymentServiceMap) {
          this.paymentServiceMap = paymentServiceMap;
      }

      @PostMapping("/pay")
      public String pay(@RequestBody PaymentRequest request) {
          PaymentService service = paymentServiceMap.get(request.getPaymentType());
          if (service == null) {
              throw new RuntimeException("Unsupported payment mode");
          }
          return service.pay(request);
      }
  }
  ```

* 💬 **Key Terminologies Used**:

    * **Map-based Injection** – Spring injects a `Map<BeanName, BeanInstance>` for a specific interface.
    * **@Service("beanName")** – Custom bean name assignment.

---

### 🔹 **Custom Bean Naming for Accurate Mapping (6:02 – 8:10)**

* 🧠 **Summary**:
  For the map to work correctly, the key must match the input string. So, override the default bean name using `@Service("paypal")`, `@Service("stripe")`, etc.

* 🛠️ **Code**:

  ```java
  @Service("paypal")
  public class PaypalPaymentService implements PaymentService {
      public String pay(PaymentRequest request) {
          return "Paid with PayPal";
      }
  }

  @Service("stripe")
  public class StripePaymentService implements PaymentService {
      public String pay(PaymentRequest request) {
          return "Paid with Stripe";
      }
  }
  ```

* 💡 **Common Problems Addressed**:

    * Avoids the mismatch between input string and default bean name (like `stripePaymentService`).
    * Simplifies dynamic bean resolution.

---

### 🔹 **Final Test and Scalability Benefits (8:10 – 10:10)**

* 🧠 **Summary**:
  Application tested via Swagger with inputs like "paypal", "stripe", etc. Shows expected responses. Invalid input gives an exception. Demonstrates how adding new implementations now requires **no controller code change**.

* 💡 **Common Problems Solved**:

    * Easy scalability.
    * Cleaner, maintainable code.
    * Eliminates if-else/switch.

* 💬 **Best Practice Advice**:
  Apply this pattern for **Factory-like logic** in Spring Boot projects.

## 🧭 **2. Quick Ref and Key Terminology with Hints**

| Term                       | Meaning / Hint                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Map-based Injection`      | Spring injects a map of all beans of a given type with keys as bean names.     |
| `@Service("beanName")`     | Customizes the name of a Spring-managed bean (used as map key).                |
| `PaymentService`           | Common interface implemented by multiple payment types (PayPal, Stripe, etc.). |
| `pay(PaymentRequest)`      | Method defined in each implementation to handle payment logic.                 |
| `Unsupported Payment Mode` | Error thrown if no matching bean is found in the map for input type.           |
