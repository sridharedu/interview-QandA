4. Inside each topic folder, also include an `interview-questions.md` file with the following characteristics:

    *   **Purpose**: To provide a set of challenging, experience-driven questions that help a senior Java developer/architect (10+ years) prepare for in-depth technical interviews.

    *   **Content**:
        *   Generate a list of 8 to 12 unique questions for the specific topic of the folder.
        *   **Question Style and Focus**:
            *   All questions must be **open-ended** and **experience-driven**. They should prompt detailed responses based on real-world scenarios rather than theoretical knowledge or simple yes/no answers.
            *   Focus exclusively on **practical application, problem-solving, architectural decision-making, handling constraints, and evaluating trade-offs**. Avoid academic or purely theoretical questions.
            *   The questions should be tailored for a **senior Java developer or architect with 10+ years of experience**. They should be challenging and probe deep understanding and seasoned judgment.

    *   **Example Question Format**:
        *   Present questions clearly, for example, as a numbered list.
        *   Here is an example of the type of question to generate:
            ```
            1. Describe a time you had to design or implement a critical microservice that had stringent uptime requirements and faced unpredictable load or dependencies. How did you approach ensuring its resilience and stability? Discuss the specific patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads) you considered or implemented (perhaps referencing your experience with tools like Resilience4j), the trade-offs you made, and how you monitored its ongoing performance and reliability in a production environment like AWS.
            ```
