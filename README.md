### ✅ **Final AI Prompt — Senior Java Interview Folder Structure**

> I want to create a **well-structured folder system** to prepare for **senior Java engineer/architect interviews**. Please:
>
> 1. Create a root directory called `interview-prep/`.
>
> 2. Under it, create one folder per topic listed below.
>
> 3. Inside each folder, include:
>
>    * `theory.md`:
>
>      * Should be clearly written, interview-focused

>      * Focus on **real-world understanding** over textbook definitions
>      * Meant to guide an experienced engineer preparing for **in-depth technical interviews**
>    * `interview-questions.md`:
>

Below is a suggested **Epic** and a breakdown into **7 detailed JIRA stories** to plan creating that refined AI prompt and folder‐structure generation task:

---

## 📦 Epic: Interview Prep Folder System Prompt

**Goal**: Craft a precise, Sridhar‐tailored LLM prompt that will output a structured, bash-style directory tree with stubbed `theory.md` and `interview-questions.md` files for each interview topic.

---

### Story IP-1: Define Interview Topics List

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Finalize the exact list of topic folder names to include under `interview-prep-sridhar-nandipati/`
**Description**:

> Gather and confirm the 27 topic names (e.g. `core-java`, `multithreading-vertx-executors`, … `agile-scrum-jira`) used in Sridhar’s experience. Ensure each matches a key skill area from his resume.
> **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. A flat list of 27 folder names is agreed.
2. Names use hyphens only, no spaces.
3. Each topic maps directly to a resume skill area.

---

### Story IP-2: Draft Root & Folder Creation Instructions

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Instruct the AI to create a root folder and one subfolder per topic
**Description**:

> Write the prompt section that tells the model to create `interview-prep-sridhar-nandipati/` as the root and under it one directory per of the 27 topics.
> **Acceptance Criteria**:

* Prompt text includes “Create a root directory called `interview-prep-sridhar-nandipati/`.”
* Prompt enumerates all 27 topics in the desired order.

---

### Story IP-3: Specify `theory.md` Guidelines

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Define in the prompt how `theory.md` should be structured
**Description**:

> Compose the part of the prompt that tells the AI:
>
> * Use `##` headings (e.g. `## Overview`, `## Deep Dive`)
> * Write concise, interview‐focused prose
> * Embed `<!-- TODO:` markers for placeholders
> * Focus on real‐world examples tied to Sridhar’s projects
>   **Acceptance Criteria**:

* Prompt text contains clear bullet points for `theory.md` structure & TODO comments.
* At least three example TODO hints are shown.

---

### Story IP-4: Specify `interview-questions.md` Guidelines

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Define in the prompt how `interview-questions.md` should be structured
**Description**:

> Draft the prompt section instructing the AI to generate:
>
> * 8–12 open-ended, experience‐driven questions
> * No theoretical Q\&A, only real‐world scenario questions
> * Tailored for 10+ years senior Java roles
>   **Acceptance Criteria**:

* Prompt text lists the requirements for `interview-questions.md`.
* Sample question format is provided in the prompt.

---

### Story IP-5: Embed Sridhar Nandipati Context

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Weave Sridhar’s resume highlights into the prompt for context
**Description**:

> Enhance the prompt by referencing Sridhar’s key projects (Intralinks BOFA, TOPS Kafka pipelines, AEM, ELK monitoring, etc.) so the AI tailors examples/TODOs to his background.
> **Acceptance Criteria**:

* Prompt mentions at least 5 project keywords.
* TODO hints reference real‐world tie‐ins (e.g., “<!-- TODO: Add example from BOFA high-throughput processing -->”).

---

### Story IP-6: Specify Output Format & Examples

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Instruct the AI to output only a bash-style tree code block
**Description**:

> Write the final section of the prompt that enforces:
>
> * Output is just the directory tree in a single fenced code block
> * Files are listed under each folder (`theory.md`, `interview-questions.md`)
> * No extra commentary outside the tree
>   **Acceptance Criteria**:

* Prompt ends with a sample snippet of the desired tree format.
* AI is told “output only the bash-style tree”.

---

### Story IP-7: Review & Refine Prompt

**Issue Type**: Story
**Summary**: Validate the prompt’s clarity, completeness, and Sridhar alignment
**Description**:

> Iterate on the draft prompt by:
>
> * Testing it against a sample LLM to ensure correct folder structure
> * Checking that TODO markers, question guidelines, and theory specs appear
> * Refining language for maximum precision
>   **Acceptance Criteria**:

* Prompt yields a correct 27-folder tree with stub files on first LLM run.
* All `theory.md` and `interview-questions.md` stubs contain the required headings and TODO comments.
* Prompt text is finalized and stored for reuse.
